# farcaster
Develop tools and application testing for UNLV capstone


Ubuntu:
first install node:
sudo apt install nodejs npm

Next install the farcaster stuff:
npm install @farcaster/miniapp-wagmi-connector

clone the repo

open a terminal in the root directory of repo, then run:
npm install


IF YOU GET AN ERROR, run these commands, then run npm install again:
unset ESBUILD_BINARY_PATH
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json



then run this after:
npm run dev

That will start the server, in the terminal it will tell you what local host to put in your browser, usually its "localhost:3000"

PLEASE NOTE: the first run will take a bit of time before it is viewable, the app is compiling, once done they screen will either refresh to the home screen or go to a black screen,
if it is a black screen just refresh the browser window, you can make changes in real to the files and the browser will update automotically, just dont close the terminal window where
you ran npm run

To edit the tabs in the app those are held in the directory:
/src/components/ui/tabs

the ui directory holds the header and footer to edit the menu

the files labled ***(old)
are the original files provided by farcaster, look in their for ideas on how to do things
